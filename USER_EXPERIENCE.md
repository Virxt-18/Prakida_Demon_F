# User Experience (UX) Analysis & Journey Map

Welcome to the **Prakida '26: Crimson Moon** experience. This document outlines how a user explores and interacts with the platform, capturing the atmospheric design and the functional journey from a common "Recruit" to a "Hashira" of the arena.

---

## 1. The Atmosphere: "Demon Slayer" Aesthetic
The website isn't just a portal; it's an immersive environment.
- **Visual Identity**: A dark, high-contrast palette with "Prakida Flame" (Orange/Red) and "Water Breath" (Cyan/Blue) accents.
- **Sensory Layers**: 
  - **Noise Overlay**: A subtle grain that adds a cinematic, vintage feel.
  - **Ash Particles**: Dynamic ash/embers drifting across the screen, mimicking a post-battle landscape.
  - **Custom Cursor**: A unique pointer experience that feels like handling a Nichirin sword (visible as you hover over interactive elements).
  - **Glitch Links**: Navigation links that "vibrate" with a digital glitch effect on hover, blending ancient theme with modern tech.

## 2. The User Journey Map

### Phase 1: Recruitment (The Landing)
A user’s first touchpoint is the **Home Page**, designed to recruit them into the "Demon Slayer Corps" (the fest attendees).
- **Hero Reveal**: A high-impact entrance with a clear call to action (CTA).
- **Hashira Showcase**: An elite gallery of categories or featured guests, styled as the highest-ranking slayers.
- **The Marquee**: A scrolling "Intel Feed" showing registration status, prize pools, and recruitment deadlines.

### Phase 2: Choosing the Battlefield (The Arena)
Users explore the **Sports** page to find their competitive niche.
- **Interactive Arena Cards**: Each sport (Cricket, Football, etc.) is presented as a "Battlefield" with technical specs:
  - Format (e.g., 11 vs 11).
  - Category (Men/Women/Open).
  - Warrior Spirit (Description).
- **Tournament Arc (Schedule)**: A structured timeline of when each "Mission" begins and ends.

### Phase 3: Final Selection (Registration)
The most critical functional part of the UX.
- **Slayer Hierarchy**: When registering, users aren't just names; they are **Captains**, **Vice-Captains**, or **Players**.
- **The Roster UI**: A dynamic table where Captains "recruit" their squad, adding member details in real-time.
- **Transmission System**: A themed submission process where data is "transmitted" to the Corps HQ, followed by a secure payment gateway.

### Phase 4: Standing at the Peak (Star Night & Merchandise)
The experience culminates in the **Star Night** (Concert/Cultural Event).
- **Event Pass UX**: A dedicated "Tickets" page where users purchase their entry to the final celebration.
- **Corps Kit (Merchandise)**: An upcoming area where users can buy themed gear to match the "Slayer" aesthetic.

## 3. Navigation & Interaction Patterns
- **The "Kanji" Navbar**: Every navigation link is accompanied by its Japanese Kanji equivalent, grounding the theme.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Framer Motion "AnimatePresence" ensures that moving between pages feels like a "Breathing Technique" transition—smooth, rhythmic, and intentional.
- **The Slayer Dashboard**: A personalized space for users to track their "Missions" (registrations) and "Passes" (tickets).
